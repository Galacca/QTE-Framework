QTE Framework for Skyrim

So this is a fun little project of mine. A friend asked for me to make a QTE for his mod. After going over some scripts. I thought maybe a framework would help people like my friend who really dislike heavy scripting. 

If you somehow stumbled upon this you are welcome to try it, just dont expect miracles. It's in the very early stages and this is also my first ever mod I've made.

If you want to see how to make another script communicate with the framework the ConfigMenu script has an example at the bottom.
Not gonna lie it's a bit convoluted right now, but I'll see if I can make it simpler.
